## Problem

Create a React frontend with a Node (micro) backend that allows a customer to create a new car subscription.

A car subscription requires:

* Information from the customer:

  * Name
  * Email
  * Date of Birth
  * Subscription Length (7 or 28 days)
  * Chosen vehicle

* Information from our services:
  * List of vehicles
    * At least description, odometer
  * Pricing

### Required Pages

1.  Create Subscription Page
2.  Success Page With Information About Subscription

### Guidelines

1.  Check into Git periodically
2.  Use any libraries you like
3.  Persistance does not need to be complicated (in-memory is fine)
4.  Take 1 - 2 hours on it
5.  Document your assumptions, describe what else would need to be done to make it "production-ready". Describe the approach you would take to test frontend and backend code.

### What We Are Looking For

1.  Coding skills
2.  Knowledge of React, NodeJS
3.  Ability to learn and apply a new library ([micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro))
